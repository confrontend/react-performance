/**
 * The creation of a function in JavaScript is not particularly complex or
 * costly in terms of performance. However, in the context of a React
 * application, the issue isnâ€™t so much about the cost of creating the function
 * itself, but rather the implications it has on the React component lifecycle.
 *
 * Every time a function is created in a component, it gets a new reference.
 * This means that even if the function does the exact same thing from render to
 * render, React sees it as a new function because it has a new reference. This
 * can lead to unnecessary re-renders if this function is passed as a prop to a
 * child component, because the child component will see it as a new prop and
 * therefore re-render.
